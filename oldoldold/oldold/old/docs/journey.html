<h2>A Journey, Frantic: In Summary</h2>
			<h3>Trepidation at the start: A looming pall</h3>
			<p>7 miles was what my odometer showed as I pulled to the side of the busy beltway. I had neglected to take my old 1984 Volkswagen bus up to speed before the day my cross-country trip was to begin, and in turn neglected to get a wheel alignment during the flurry of repairs previous. Principally, the word neglected stood out to me, bringing forth an anecdote captured when I was small, young, and sitting around a wooden table in the quiet woodland evenings of a Massachusetts summertime. It was my grandmother, recalling to me whilst playing bridge: "many a man has walked across London bridge at night without any coat for neglecting to draw trumps." I was suddenly this coatless individual transported to the side of the highway.</p>

			<p>I refused to turn back, at this point I was on the road and 7 miles nor 700 mattered not. Only disaster would drive me to any measure of aid. I drove off to Kensignton Auto (a limping beltway exit only a half mile distant). Sadly, they were closing and couldn't help me, but directed me to Merchant's auto. Merchant's simply refused but recommended the dealership. The dealership, who impressed by my creation of a solar powered home still would not be able to fit it in that day and recommended Mr. Tire. And so off I went to Mr. Tire and met Billy, a nice guy who convinced me to get new front tires along with the alignment.</p>

			<p>The tire store parlor turned busy as that day was the third place match between Brazil and the Netherlands in the world cup. Billy had happily told me it would probably take about 90 minutes for the work as it became apparent what everyone around would be doing for the next hour and a half. Quite a collection of folks joined us in front of the television set as those who had come to pick up their cars realized they could take part in that great hive mind like behavior that surrounds collective sporting events. It was in spanish but this didn't matter as football is Universal.</p>

			<p>There was about a dozen of us there, and the shop soon became a hive of world cup fandom. The third place Brazil-Netherlands game was on that afternoon and all of us were soon huddled around the TV watching the game in Spanish.</p>

			<p>I slept in a truck stop, pulled in alongside all the 18-wheelers. I discovered shortly upon departing that my cruising speed was somewhere around 60mph as I lacked a fifth gear. This begun the journey in which even the trucks would whiz past me on the highway and where my fate was to be a meandering westward bound explorer.</p>

			<p>When I got to Cleveland, I visited with my compatriot matt and we went down to a local pub to watch the world cup finals. I wore my germany shirt and cheered loudly. Then we went for a 25 mile bike ride through the park, looking at plaques detailing the planets and spaced representationly.</p>

			<p>In Des Moines. I had to get my van's oil changed here and also got the wheels retorqued as I was worried about a rattle that originates above the headboard when there is a crosswind.</p>

			<p>I met a girl in indiana who gave me a dozen free donuts. They sustained me through the long journey across Iowa. At this point I had listened to most of the radiolabs (highly recommended). </p>

			<p>I visited with my father in Chicago and thought the city was beautiful. By the time I had gotten there, both my father and myself were stressed but for different reasons. We were able to get food and mutually relax as to the stressors weighing on our shoulders.</p> 

			<p>In Fort Collins. I stopped in at Rocky Mountain Westy and they gave my vanagon the once over and assured me nothing was going to give out on me before I made it to California. They liked the van, said it was in great shape, and thought I would make a profit if I sold it in California.</p>

			<p>I had a wonderful trip driving across nebraska alongside a train. As I can't go the 80mph highway speed, I peacefully jaunted along on the roads parallel to the highways, those that had been the paths west and which run through mostly abandoned grain towns. I slept by a nice lake on the Colorado border but in the morning drove down to the short which was a mistake as it left me mired. After many attempts to carve a path out for my van by digging in the sand, a truck with big tires swung by and was able to tow me out of the beach. There were a few close spots as they hauled me up a sandy slope, spitting sand up from their tires, but finally we made it back to higher and solid ground.</p>

			<p>In Las Vegas. A wild ride down here through the 110 degree heat proved that my Vanagon can still make it, 30 years later! The casinos had gone to great lengths to create these internal artificial worlds, and it was wild to explore inside.</p>

			In San Diego.
