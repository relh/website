<h3> CURRENT: </h3>
<p>In the Bay Area! I had a wonderful and relaxed journey up the western coast. I stopped in Riverside to visit Nic who is living alone in a big house while attending graduate school at Riverside and needs more friends. Traveling along the coast on California 1 I feasted on the leftovers from the wedding and had a great time sitting by the water/on the beach. I made it to Oxnard and saw a wonderful 33ft Freedom from 1980 but passed on swapping my van for it as I still had a final northern destination. I stayed at a wonderful campground (Mcgrath) which was expensive but offered me the chance to have a night down by the ocean. Driving north I stopped in Morro bay, a great town with a slightly sheltered inlet and a cool boardwalk along the waterfront. In the same day I did the long haul up through central California and went on the best and most beautiful drive of my entire life. Big Sur is amazing and I will journey back one day. In the same night I pushed through to San Jose to visit Dan who I havent seen in a long while. The next day I tagged along with him and co. into work and got my first taste of silicon valley. They had catered lunch and the whole place was a setup of lavish and productive. The next few days have seen me wandering around the bay area, looking at pretty boats and coding. I've been implementing different neural networks I've found in various papers and think I've learnt enough to make something that will work on the stock data.</p>
