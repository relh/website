abstract = {OBJECTIVES: To determine the mechanism of action of valproic acid
(VPA) in the adult central nervous system (CNS) following
traumatic brain injury (TBI) and hemorrhagic shock (HS). METHODS:
Data were analyzed from different sources, including experiments
in a porcine model, data from postmortem human brain, published
studies, public and commercial databases. RESULTS: The
transcriptional program in the CNS following TBI, HS, and VPA
treatment includes activation of regulatory pathways that enhance
neurogenesis and suppress gliogenesis. Genes which encode the
transcription factors (TFs) that specify neuronal cell fate,
including MEF2D, MYT1L, NEUROD1, PAX6 and TBR1, and their target
genes, are induced by VPA. VPA represses genes responsible for
oligodendrogenesis, maintenance of white matter, T-cell
activation, angiogenesis, and endothelial cell proliferation,
adhesion and chemotaxis. NEUROD1 has regulatory interactions with
38{\%} of the genes regulated by VPA in a swine model of TBI and HS
in adult brain. Hi-C spatial mapping of a VPA pharmacogenomic SNP
in the GRIN2B gene shows it is part of a transcriptional hub that
contacts 12 genes that mediate chromatin-mediated neurogenesis
and neuroplasticity. CONCLUSIONS: Following TBI and HS, this
study shows that VPA administration acts in the adult brain
through differential activation of TFs responsible for
neurogenesis, genes responsible for neuroplasticity, and
repression of TFs that specify oligodendrocyte cell fate,
endothelial cell chemotaxis and angiogenesis. Short title:
